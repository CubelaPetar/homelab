# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Rules Set 

1. Ask, don't assume. If something is unclear, ask before writing a single line. Never make silent assumptions about intent, architecture, or requirements.
2. Simplest solution first. Always implement the simplest thing that could work. Do not add abstractions or flexibility that weren't explicitly requested. 
3. Don't touch unrelated code. If a file or function is not directly part of the current task, do not modify it, even if you think it could be improved.
4. Flag uncertainty explicitly. If you are not confident about an approach or technical detail, say so before proceeding. Confidence without certainty causes more damage than admitting a gap.


## Common Commands

All shortcuts are in the `justfile` (run with `just`):

```bash
just run <HOST> [TAGS]        # Run the main playbook against a specific host
just compose <HOST>           # Deploy only Docker Compose stacks to a host
just reqs [--force]           # Install Ansible Galaxy roles from requirements.yml
just vault <encrypt|decrypt|edit>  # Manage secrets.yml via ansible-vault (opens nvim)
```

Direct Ansible equivalents:

```bash
ansible-playbook -b run.yml --limit media          # Full run against media VM
ansible-playbook run.yml --limit media --tags compose  # Compose stacks only
ansible-playbook playbooks/update.yml              # Dist-upgrade all hosts
ansible-playbook playbooks/shutdown.yml            # Graceful shutdown
ansible-vault edit group_vars/secrets.yml          # Edit encrypted secrets
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml         # Install galaxy roles
```

## Architecture

### How services are deployed

Docker Compose stacks are **generated from Jinja2 templates** using the `ironicbadger.docker_compose_generator` Galaxy role. The source definitions live in `services/<host_group>/` as numbered subdirectories (e.g. `01-traefik`, `02-jellyfin`). Ansible renders them into `~/docker/` on the target host and runs `docker compose up -d`. Lower numbers start first — order matters for network/dependency reasons.

The `run.yml` playbook is the single entrypoint for all hosts. Each play targets a host group, loads `group_vars/secrets.yml`, and applies roles. The `compose` tag is the fast path to redeploy stacks without running the full role chain.

### Secrets

All secrets are in `group_vars/secrets.yml`, encrypted with `ansible-vault`. The vault password must be available (file or env var) for any playbook run that loads secrets. Do not add plaintext secrets anywhere else.

### Variables layering

- `group_vars/all.yml` — global defaults (`main_username`, `docker_dir`, NTP timezone, base domains)
- `group_vars/<group>.yml` — per-host-group overrides (paths, NFS mounts, service-specific vars)
- `group_vars/secrets.yml` — vault-encrypted credentials, tokens, passwords

Key globals: `main_username=reliyya`, `main_uid=1000`, `docker_dir=/home/reliyya/docker`, `domain_base=reliyya.xyz`.

### Inventory structure

`hosts.ini` defines all hosts. Notable groups:
- `homelab` — all home nodes (turtle + turtleskids + llm)
- `turtleskids` — VMs and services running on pve-turtle (media, ad, caddy, pihole, etc.)
- `vps` — cloud VPS and petarcubela VPS (SSH port 69, user `petar`)
- `homelab` group uses SSH port 2222, user `reliyya` by default

### NFS dependency

The `media` and `llm` hosts mount `/mnt/nfs/appdata` and `/mnt/nfs/media` from `nas.reliyya.xyz` (pve-turtle) over NFS. The `nfs-client` role manages `/etc/fstab` entries. Service containers expect these mounts to exist before starting — the `_netdev` mount option ensures NFS waits for the network.

### Custom roles

Local roles in `roles/` (not from Galaxy):
- `caddy` / `caddy_srv` / `caddy_dmz` — Caddy reverse proxy for different network zones (LAN, server VLAN, DMZ)
- `dhcp-dns` — Pi-hole DHCP/DNS configuration
- `disks` / `snapraid` — disk setup and SnapRAID parity config for turtle and jc_pve
- `nfs-client` — NFS mount management via fstab
- `packages` — base package installs
- `samba` — SMB share configuration
- `smtp` — mail relay
- `autorestic` — restic backup wrapper (currently commented out in run.yml)

### Scripts submodule

`scripts/` is a git submodule pointing to `https://git.reliyya.xyz/petar.cubela/scripts.git`. After cloning, run `git submodule update --init` to populate it.
